# Exit-Surveys

In this project, we clean and analyze exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) body of the Queensland government in Australia. The TAFE exit survey can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).

There's recently been a lot of turnover that the departments heads need help investigating. Specifically, they want to know: 

> Did employees who worked for the institutes for only a couple years resign due to dissatisfaction at higher rates than employees with longer tenures?

# Summary of Results

After analyzing the data, we found that about 50% of resignations with 7 or more years of service left due to some kind of job dissatisfaction, whereas only about 30% of people with less than 7 years left for those reasons. For more details, see the analysis.
